When trying to automate the provisioning of an Amazon EC2, there are many solutions including Amazon's very own CloudFormation. However, instead of investigating the built-in solution, I have decided to use Terraform because of the similarities between CloudFormation and Terraform. Additionally, I am interested in the solutions of Apache Libcloud, Ansible, Salt Stack, and Terraform.

**Note:** I realize there are other solutions for provisioning infrastructure such as Chef, Puppet, etc. However, I am currently just interested in Ansible, Apache Libcloud, Salt Stack, and Terraform because well... I don't want to set up servers to provision additional servers. 

## Purpose:

This repo provisions a single EC2 instance that is running an **nginx** server. Additionally, I am going to use the simplest solution for each of the technologies that I can as to remove some of the abstractions that are employed for the each of the tools.

Let's take a look at a brief overview of each of the technologies:

### Terraform

### Ansible

### Salt Stack

### Apache Libcloud
